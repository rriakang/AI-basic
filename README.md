## Practice numpy

NumPy is a linear algebraic library that performs numerical operations of matrices such as vectors and hangings in Python. 

The characteristic is that it is implemented internally with C, so the calculation speed is fast.

## But why do you use it?

We touch a lot of data, so it's essential to manipulate it quickly.

You need to know how to create and handle arrays, and you can use the Nupi library to create arrays and generate descriptive statistics, which are useful for generating random numbers and analyzing the results.
